# Understanding Building Energy Consumption and Embedded Generation

## Abstract

This report presents an analysis of various graphs related to energy consumption and embedded generation in buildings. The primary goal is to identify trends, patterns, anomalies, and unexpected findings within the data. Through this understanding, insights into building energy use are derived, and opportunities for improvement are explored.

## Introduction

Reducing energy consumption in buildings is essential for promoting environmental sustainability and improving economic efficiency. This project focuses on analyzing energy usage patterns across a collection of buildings. By understanding these patterns, strategies can be developed to optimize energy use.

## Project Structure

- **EDA Reports**: The exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports are located in the `/reports` directory of this repository. Each report includes visualizations such as stacked bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and more, all of which offer insight into building energy consumption.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive analysis notebooks used for generating the visualizations and performing data analysis can be found in the `/notebooks` directory. These can be run locally to reproduce the analysis or modify it with new data.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MMZeeshanAI/building-energy-analysis.git
   cd building-energy-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:

   Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the `/notebooks` folder and open the desired notebook for analysis.

## Data Analysis Overview

The report covers the following aspects:

1. **General Trends and Patterns**:  
   Analysis using stacked bar charts and boxplots to understand seasonal energy consumption patterns and the distribution of power factor values.

2. **Deviations and Anomalies**:  
   Scatter plots and heatmaps help detect unexpected findings and deviations from general trends, such as anomalies in embedded generation and weak correlations between power consumption and other variables.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following suggestions are made:

- Targeted energy-saving campaigns can be developed for sectors exhibiting specific consumption patterns.
- Further investigation into outliers can help uncover the reasons for unexpected energy behaviors.
- Implementation of smart energy management systems is recommended to optimize building energy consumption based on real-time data analysis.

## Conclusion

This project has provided a detailed exploration of energy consumption trends within buildings, revealing important insights for potential energy efficiency improvements. By leveraging the results of the analysis, stakeholders can design more effective strategies for sustainable energy use.
